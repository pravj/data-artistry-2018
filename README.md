### Why did you use this tool?
I have used D3 as the core tool for the visualization. The main reason is the maturity the project provides, both in terms of features/API and community support. Also, I have used MapBox for one of map charts.

### Why did you pick the particular dataset?
I am a Cricket fan, was a great fielder and a medium fast bowler in my childhood. Also, I was thinking of working on another side-project using the old matches data, and them came this tournament. I would love to utilize the dataset further and work on it.

### Pros & cons of the tool
+ D3 community, there are more and more tools to get people started. Be it "bl.ocks" or "blockbuilder" or the latest "observable".
+ Similar to the goodness provided by GitHub, you can fork an existing block and implement it according to your needs.
- I find that writing D3 is a little verbose. I haven't tried Vega and other DSL sort of toos, would love to frame an opinion about them too.

### Ease of implementation / adoption
If I'm getting this question correctly, it was relatively easy for the chart other than the "slopegraph" that I've created. For it, I have used a block as a reference and it was the tough part. Overall, D3 is one my favorite tools anyway.

> As my teamname (timeconstraint) for the tournament suggests, I didn't get much time to work on it. (Worked only on March 4 and 9)
